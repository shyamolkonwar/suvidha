Dashboard Documentation: The Citizen Command Center
1. Design Philosophy: "Radical Clarity"
Most government dashboards are cluttered. Ours is Ruthless.
Visual Style: "Card-Based UI." Everything is contained in clean, white, rounded cards with soft green shadows.
Hierarchy: The most important thing (How much do I owe?) is the biggest thing.
Color Strategy:
Good Status: Signal Green text/icons.
Attention Needed: Deep Forest background (High Contrast).
Background: Cool Gray (#F3F4F6) to make the white cards "float."
2. Layout Architecture (The "Bento" Grid)
The screen is divided into a 3-Column Grid (Left Sidebar, Center Stage, Right Feed).

Zone A: The Identity Sidebar (Left - 20%)
Context: "Who is in control?"
Profile Card (Top):
Visual: A glass-effect card with the user's photo (or generic avatar) and Name.
Badge: "Smart Citizen" (Green Pill).
Details: Zone ID, Phone Number (masked).
Navigation Dock (Vertical):
Menu Items: Overview, Payments, Grievances, History, Settings.
Active State: The active tab is filled with Mint Mist and has a thick Signal Green border on the left.
Logout Button (Bottom):
Minimalist text: "Secure Exit" (Red hover effect).
Zone B: The Action Stage (Center - 55%)
Context: "What needs to be done?"

Widget 1: The "Unified Liability" Card (The Hero)
Visual: A large, Deep Forest Green card (spanning full width of the center zone).
Content:
Text: "Total Outstanding Dues" (White, opacity 80%).
Number: ₹ 4,250.00 (Huge, White, Bold font).
Breakdown: Small text below: Electricity (₹2200) + Water (₹850) + Gas (₹1200).
Primary Action: A massive, glowing white button: [ PAY ALL ].
Why: This is the "One-Click Solution." It solves all their problems instantly.
Widget 2: The Service Status Grid (Below the Hero)
Layout: Two square cards side-by-side.
Card A: Electricity Monitor:
Icon: ⚡ (Green).
Graph: A small sparkline chart showing usage trend (Generated by Python backend).
Status: "Normal • 2.4kW Load".
Card B: Water Supply:
Icon: 💧 (Blue-Green).
Status: "Supply Active • Next: 6 PM".
Alert: "Tank Cleaning Scheduled" (Small text).
Zone C: The Intelligence Feed (Right - 25%)
Context: "What is happening around me?"

Widget 1: The "Live City" Ticker
Header: "Local Updates"
Format: A vertical list of notifications.
Item 1: "🚧 Road work in Sector 4 (Delay expected)."
Item 2: "📢 Property Tax rebate ends in 2 days."
Tech: Powered by Redis. These updates push instantly without refreshing the page.
Widget 2: Quick Grievance (The "Voice" Box)
Header: "Report an Issue"
Visual: A large microphone icon.
Text: "Tap to Speak Complaint."
Interaction: Tapping this opens the Voice Recording overlay (Innovation point).
3. Interaction Design (The "Feel")
The "Pay" Flow:
User taps [ PAY ALL ].
Instead of a new page, a "Slide-Over Panel" enters from the right.
It shows the Bill Summary and a QR Code (UPI).
Why: Keeping context is premium. Redirecting feels cheap.
The "Hover" Physics:
Hovering over any service card causes it to lift slightly (translate-y-1) and the shadow turns green. This tactile feedback makes the screen feel responsive and alive.
4. Technical Integration (The "Engine" Room)
This is how your Python Backend and Next.js Frontend talk here.
Data Aggregation (Python/FastAPI):
When the Dashboard loads, Next.js calls one API: GET /dashboard/summary.
The Python Script:
Checks Redis for cached data (Is the bill already calculated?).
If not, it queries Supabase (Sum of electricity_bills + water_bills).
Returns a neat JSON object to the frontend.
Result: The dashboard loads in < 200ms. Blazing fast.
Real-Time Status (Supabase Realtime):
The "Live City Ticker" subscribes to the city_alerts table in Supabase.
When the Admin adds an alert, it pops up on the Dashboard instantly without refreshing.
Voice Processing (The Innovation):
The "Microphone" button records audio (HTML5 API).
Sends the "Blob" to Python (POST /grievance/audio).
Python uses a simple Speech-to-Text library (like SpeechRecognition or OpenAI Whisper API) to convert it to text and file the complaint.
