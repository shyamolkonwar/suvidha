1. Design System: "Eco-Modern"
Color Palette (The "Green Hierarchy")
We use shades of green to denote status and action, keeping the background clean white.

Color Name	Hex Code	Usage	Visual Effect
Deep Forest	#064E3B	Primary Headings, Navbar Background	Trust, Authority, Stability
Signal Green	#10B981	Primary Buttons (CTA), Active States	Energy, "Go", Success
Mint Mist	#D1FAE5	Secondary Buttons, Section Backgrounds	Softness, Approachability
Pure White	#FFFFFF	Card Backgrounds, Main Canvas	Cleanliness, Space
Gunmetal	#1F2937	Body Text	High Readability (Softer than black)
Typography (The "Global-Local" Pair)
English: Inter (Google Font). A variable font that is clean, geometric, and highly legible on screens.
Hindi/Regional: Hind (Google Font). Designed to match the geometry of Inter, ensuring the UI looks consistent even when the language switches.
Shadows & Depth (Glassmorphism)
Card Shadow: 0 10px 15px -3px rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.1) (A soft, green-tinted glow).
Glass Effect: backdrop-filter: blur(12px); background: rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8); (Used for the Floating Navbar).
2. The Floating Navbar (Navigation)
Instead of a boring bar stuck to the top, we use a "Floating Capsule" navbar. It sits 20px from the top, centered or spanning 90% width, floating above the content like a modern app header.

Specs:
Position: fixed, top-4, inset-x-0 (Tailwind classes).
Style: Pill-shaped rounded corners (rounded-full).
Background: White with 80% opacity + Blur (Glassmorphism).
Border: Thin, subtle green (border border-green-100).
Layout:
Left: Logo (Text: "SUVIDHA" in Deep Forest Bold + Green Leaf Icon).
Center: Links (Hidden on Mobile, Visible on Desktop).
Home, Services, Track Status, Help.
Hover State: Text turns Signal Green and a small green dot appears below the text.
Right: "Access" Button.
Style: Gradient Green Pill Button.
Text: "Citizen Login".
3. Hero Section (The "First Impression")
This is the most critical part. It must be clean. No clutter.

Background: A split layout or a subtle mesh gradient.
CSS Gradient: background: radial-gradient(circle at 50% 50%, #ECFDF5 0%, #FFFFFF 100%); (A soft glow of Mint Green in the center).
Content Alignment:
Left (Text):
Badge: A small pill tag saying 🚀 SUVIDHA 2.0 IS LIVE (Mint bg, Green text).
Headline: Huge, Bold, Tight line height.
"Governance at the Speed of Light."
Sub-headline: "Pay bills, report issues, and manage your city life. Zero queues. Zero paperwork."
CTA Button: (See Section 4).
Right (Visual):
Instead of a stock photo of a handshake, use a 3D Floating Illustration or a High-Quality Vector of a Smart City Dashboard tilting in 3D space.
4. Button Architecture
Buttons are the main interaction points. They must feel "tactile."

Primary CTA (The "Pay Now" / "Login" Button)
Shape: Fully Rounded (rounded-full).
Color: bg-emerald-500 hover:bg-emerald-600.
Text: White, Semibold.
Effect: When hovered, it lifts up slightly (transform -translate-y-1) and casts a soft green shadow (shadow-lg shadow-emerald-500/30).
Code Concept:
CSS
.btn-primary {
  background: #10B981;
  color: white;
  padding: 12px 32px;
  border-radius: 9999px;
  box-shadow: 0 4px 14px 0 rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.39);
  transition: transform 0.2s ease, box-shadow 0.2s ease;
}
.btn-primary:hover {
  transform: translateY(-2px);
  box-shadow: 0 6px 20px 0 rgba(16, 185, 129, 0.23);
}
Secondary Button (The "Learn More" Button)
Shape: Fully Rounded.
Background: Transparent.
Border: 2px solid Mint Mist.
Text: Deep Forest.
Hover: Fills with Mint Mist.
5. Service Cards (The "Bento Grid")
Below the Hero section, use a Bento Grid layout (like Apple's promotional cards) to show services.
Style: Large, white, rounded rectangles (rounded-3xl).
Hover: The card border lights up in Green.
Iconography: Use Duotone Icons (Two shades of green).
Example: An Electricity Bolt where half is Dark Green and half is Light Mint.
Card Layout:
Electricity: Large card. Shows a "Live Graph" placeholder.
Water: Medium card. Shows a "Drop" icon.
Municipal: Medium card. Shows a "Building" icon.
6. Responsive Behavior (Mobile)
Navbar: On mobile, the "Center Links" disappear. The "Logo" stays left, and a "Hamburger Menu" (Two simple lines, not three) appears on the right.
Hero Text: Center-aligned on mobile. Size scales down from text-6xl to text-4xl.
Grid: The Bento Grid turns into a single-column vertical stack.
